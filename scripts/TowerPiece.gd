extends RigidBody2D
class_name TowerPiece

## One car-tetromino brick in Pile Up (GameSettings.MODE_TOWER).
##
## This is a real `RigidBody2D` and nothing about it snaps to a grid — the
## whole mode is built on the bricks actually toppling, sliding and settling,
## so a brick's resting place is wherever the solver puts it. The only time
## its transform is written by hand is on the way down, while the active
## player is still steering it (`set_held(true)`), and even then the body is
## taken out of the collision world entirely so a descending brick can't
## shove the tower it is about to land on. TowerMode resolves its contacts
## by shape query instead — see that script's header.
##
## The art comes from GameSettings.TETROMINOES, whose sprites are normalised
## to exact square cells by scripts/dev/extract_blocks.py — so the collision
## boxes below, which are specified in cell units, line up with what is drawn
## without any per-piece correction. See that script's header for why the
## source sheet needed normalising.

# Bricks are meant to grip: a tower that slides apart under its own weight is

# Deliberately light. Damping is not how a stack is meant to settle (that is
# what can_sleep is for); it is here only to take the ring out of a hard
# landing so a tower stops quivering in a second rather than five. Raising
# these makes the fall feel like it is happening in syrup — if settling is
# ever too slow, TowerMode's SETTLE_* thresholds are the knob, not these.

# Terminal velocity.
#
# This used to be the mode's single most important number, back when a brick
# was released from a height and arrived under plain gravity at ~670px/s —
# fast enough that it demolished the tower rather than stacking on it, which
# TowerProbe caught by measuring careful drops losing bricks at the same rate
# as terrible ones. Landings are no longer that: a brick now descends under
# the player's control at DESCEND_SPEED and is handed to the physics engine
# at the instant it touches, with no velocity at all.
#
# So what this governs now is everything *after* a landing — bricks shoved
# off a collapsing tower, and the tower falling in on itself. Keeping it
# means a collapse reads as heavy but never ballistic. It is scaled to the
# cell size (about 6 cells per second), so it must be re-derived if CELL
# changes, or a collapse at a new scale will feel like a different game.

# brick looks the same. Fades out once it lands (see GLOW_FADE).

# two shape RIDs per brick — which is exactly what the first version did, and
# Godot reported it as leaks at exit.
#
# `body_*` mirrors the real collision. `foot_shapes` are thin probes placed
# just under each box, used to ask the different question "is anything
# holding this brick up?" — refusing a move and landing a brick are not the
# same event, and treating them as one is what made a brick go limp the
# moment it brushed the flank of a taller stack. They are inset horizontally
# (FOOT_INSET) precisely so a wall pressed flat against the brick's side
# cannot register as support, and only a surface actually beneath it can.
#
# Note the feet carry no baked transform, unlike body_xforms. "Underneath" is
# a question about the *world*, not about the brick: a foot offset stored in
# the brick's own frame rotates with it, so a brick turned a half turn ends
# up probing the sky. (That is not hypothetical — it shipped that way, and
# three quarters of landings silently stopped detecting their own support.)
# TowerMode._supported() therefore sizes and places these against the world
# axes at query time; they are scratch resources, reused every call.
