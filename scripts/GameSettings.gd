# one idea: **who a turn belongs to**. In free-for-all that is one player, and
# everything else is a generalisation of it — a team is a set of players who
# share a life pool and take the team's turns in rotation, so free-for-all is
# just every player on a team of one. That is why the original mode is still
# the default and why its probes still mean what they did.

# --- Pile Up's cups ----------------------------------------------------------
# A cup is a run of rounds, each one a *different* variant in turn — the
# solo cup goes free-for-all (last builder standing), the race, co-op, the
# team cup teams, team race, co-pilot — scored by where you finished:
# 3 trophies for 1st, 2 for 2nd, 1 for 3rd, none for 4th. First to
# CUP_TARGET wins the cup. TowerCup is the tally screen between rounds.
#
# A trophy is drawn as a car, and the car is the round's *winner's*, not the
# row owner's: when blue wins a round, blue takes three blue cars, 2nd takes
# two blue cars and 3rd one; when purple wins the next, that round's trophies
# are all purple. So a row is its own history, read left to right — whose
# rounds you were placing in, as well as how well — and the winner of every
# round is on every row that scored in it. Asked for exactly like that.
#
# It lives here because it is the one thing in Pile Up that outlives a scene:
# every round is a fresh TowerMode or TowerRace, and this autoload is what is
# still there when the next one loads. Plain data only, same rule as above.
#
# A *competitor* is whoever a round is decided between, and it is always a
# team index of the round's variant: in the solo cup that is the player's
# own slot (tower_team_of() is the slot in free-for-all and the solo race),
# and in the team cup it is the side — slot parity — which is the same pair of
# teams in all three team variants. So a round's result is just its teams
# from best to worst, and nothing here has to know which variant produced it.

# --- Bricks ----------------------------------------------------------------------

# The nineteen bricks Pile Up drops: the seven tetrominoes and all twelve
# pentominoes, extracted from the user's tat1.png - tat6.png by
# scripts/dev/extract_blocks.py. Every sprite is normalised there to an exact
# `cols x rows` grid of square cells, so one scale factor (cell / 100) fits
# any of them and nothing here needs a per-piece fudge.
#
# These entries follow the art rather than the other way round. The previous
# sheet drew each cell as its own upright little panel (a wheel, a battery),
# so its pieces could not be rotated to fit a footprint and the extractor had
# to re-lay their cells instead; this art is flat colour inside an outline and
# has no up, so the shapes here are simply the shapes as drawn. `cols`/`rows`
# and `boxes` still have to agree with the art exactly — extract_blocks.py's
# GRID table is where that agreement is checked, and nothing checks it at
# runtime.
#
# `boxes` is the piece's collision, in cell units measured from the top-left
# of its own bounding box. It is deliberately *merged rectangles* rather than
# one box per cell: a stack of four separate unit boxes presents internal
# edges that a neighbouring brick's corner can catch on, which reads as a
# tower snagging on nothing. Every shape here covers in two or three
# rectangles, so the merged form costs nothing and is strictly more stable.
# They are generated by extract_blocks.py's decompose(), not written by hand.
#
# `color` is a flat approximation of each sprite's body hue, for the UI bits
# that need a plain Color rather than the texture (the next-piece card, the
# landing flash) — same role, and same caveat about not updating itself, as
# PLAYER_SKINS' own "color" entry.
#
# `classic` is the brick's *category*, and it is the one field here that is
# about the draw rather than about the brick. True for the seven Tetris
# pieces, false for the twelve pentominoes. The draw is not uniform: a
# classic is TowerMode.CLASSIC_BIAS times likelier than an odd one, per
# brick, because a uniform draw over nineteen shapes made two bricks in three
# a five-cell piece and the odd ones stopped reading as odd. The split is
# stated in one place — that constant — and this flag is only the input to
# it, so the ordering of this array still carries no weight.
