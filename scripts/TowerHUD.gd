class_name TowerHUD

## Pile Up's heads-up display: one card per player (colour, name, lives), the
## next brick, the controls for whoever is on the clock, and the transient
## "-1 LIFE" toast.
##
## Lives are the whole state of a Pile Up match, and on a shared tower they
## are the only thing on screen that says who is who — every landed brick
## looks the same regardless of who dropped it, by design. So this is drawn
## rather than laid out with Labels: TowerMode pushes its state into the
## fields below and calls queue_redraw(), same pattern as PlayerBoard's own
## _draw()-based bars.
##
## ## Why the lives are hearts and not circles
##
## They used to be flat filled/hollow circles, drawn here, while Don't Crash
## trailed the user's pixel-art heart behind each car. Two modes off one menu,
## sharing a colour per player and a countdown, drawing the same fact two
## different ways: a player who has just come from the other mode has to learn
## a second symbol for "a life" on a screen where lives are the entire score.
## The pip is now the same art through `HeartPips` — same PNG, same per-player
## recolour, same swell-and-fade when one is spent — and the only thing this
## file decides is how big it is drawn and where it sits.
##
## Drawn, not tweened: this HUD has no Sprite2D to hang a Tween on, so the
## spent pip is interpolated by hand in _draw() off `_loss_timer`. Both halves
## of that gesture (`HeartPips.LOSS_POP`, `loss_pose`) come out of the shared
## file precisely so "by hand" cannot quietly become "differently".
##
## ## Why it lives in the side columns
##
## The playfield is inherently a tall narrow shaft — a tower is five cells
## wide — while the viewport is 1500x800. Laid out as a strip across the top
## (the first version) the HUD left roughly 600px of empty background down
## each side and also squeezed the drop zone, forcing the held brick low
## enough that a vertical I piece collided with the player cards. Moving the
## panels into the columns the tower was never going to use fixes both at
## once: the dead space carries something worth reading, and the entire top
## of the screen goes back to being drop headroom.
