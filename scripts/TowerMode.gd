## Pile Up — the second game mode (GameSettings.MODE_TOWER).
##
## Every player builds the *same* tower, one brick at a time, on one narrow
## platform. Whoever is on the clock steers a car-tetromino down onto the
## stack; once everything has stopped moving, anything that fell off the
## platform during that turn costs the player who dropped it a life. Last
## player with a life left wins. That is the whole rule set, and the shared
## tower is what makes it different from Tricky Towers' survival mode, which
## it is otherwise modelled on: you are not racing your own pile, you are
## inheriting whatever the last player left you, and knocking someone else's
## brick off is your problem, not theirs.
##
## ## Why it is turn-based
##
## The fault rule ("the one who drops a brick loses a life") only has an
## answer if exactly one player can be responsible for the state of the tower
## at a time. With everyone dropping at once onto one stack, a collapse has
## no author. So turns are not a simplification of the design — they are what
## makes the scoring rule well-defined.
##
## ## How a brick is flown down
##
## The brick descends on its own from the moment it appears, slowly, and the
## turn ends when it touches something. There is no "release" button: the
## player's job is to steer and turn it during the fall, and `down` makes it
## fall faster once they are happy with the line.
##
## Sideways movement is **discrete**, not a slide — a press moves the brick
## exactly half a cell, and the dash button moves it exactly one, faster and
## with an afterimage so the two can be told apart. Since a brick starts at
## x=0 and every command is a multiple of half a cell, it stays on an exact
## half-cell lattice for its whole descent, which is what makes it possible
## to line an edge up with the tower below by counting presses instead of by
## eye.
##
## While it is under the player's control the brick is frozen AND out of the
## collision world (see TowerPiece.set_held), so it can never shove the tower
## it is about to land on. Contact is instead resolved by *asking*: every
## move — sideways, rotational, downward — is tested with `intersect_shape`
## against where the brick would be, and refused if that space is occupied. A
## refused downward move is what "landed" means, and at that instant the
## brick is handed to the physics engine exactly where it stopped.
##
## That is also why exact discrete movement is possible at all. A brick that
## was really falling could not be stepped a half cell sideways without
## risking it ending up inside the tower; a brick whose every move is
## permission-checked can be put anywhere that is empty, precisely.
##
## ## Structure
##
## Nothing here is shared with Don't Crash except GameSettings, the menu flow
## and the key bindings. That mode is N independent scrolling boards with
## Area2D traffic and no rigid bodies at all; this one is a single world with
## real RigidBody2D physics. They have no geometry, camera model or update
## loop in common, so this is a separate scene and script rather than a
## variant of Main/PlayerBoard — see docs/PROJECT_STATE.md.

const PIECE_SCENE := preload("res://scenes/TowerPiece.tscn")

# --- Playfield -------------------------------------------------------------
# The world origin IS the platform's top surface, so the tower grows toward
# -y and "how tall is it" is just -stack_top_y. Every constant below is in
# those units.
#
# Cell size is set by the *vertical* budget, not the horizontal one. The
# viewport is 1500x800, so width is never the constraint — a tower is only
# ever a few cells wide — while height decides how much of the tower you can
# see at once. At 38px about twenty-one cells fit on screen, which is what
# lets a tall tower read as tall; the first version at 58px could show only
# five and a half cells of tower beneath the brick in play, so the tower kept
# scrolling out from under itself.
const CELL := 38.0
const PLATFORM_CELLS := 5.0
const PLATFORM_THICKNESS := 30.0 # the collision slab; the drawn outcrop runs much deeper

# World y of the near ground — the grass shelf the outcrop grows out of, and
# the surface the whole scene is anchored to. TowerGround draws the band here
# and TowerBackground lines its own ground line up with it, so the outcrop
# stands in real ground instead of on a table. Also the height of the
# outcrop, since the tower's surface is y = 0.
const GROUND_Y := 120.0
const OUTCROP_FLARE := 26.0 # how much wider the rock is where it meets the ground
const OUTCROP_BURY := 40.0 # how far it continues below the ground line, so it never floats

# How far past the platform's own edge a brick's outer edge may be steered.
# This is the mode's main difficulty knob: it is what lets a player choose to
# overhang deliberately, and it is measured against the brick's *rotated*
# width so a long piece cannot be walked further out than a short one.
#
# Note this bound keeps the half-cell lattice exact rather than truncating
# it: the limit works out to (2.5 + AIM_BOUND_CELLS - half the brick's width
# in cells) cells, and a brick's half-width is always a whole number of half
# cells, so as long as this constant stays a multiple of 0.5, clamping lands
# on the lattice instead of somewhere between two steps. It is not free to be
# any number.
#
# 2.0 → 2.5 on request, for a little more room to the sides. It widens the
# shaded play column and the height guides with it, since both are drawn from
# this constant, and it does not touch PLATFORM_CELLS — the platform is the
# same size, there is just more air either side of it that a brick may be
# steered over. Measured cost with TowerProbe, which aims as a fraction of
# the legal range and so models a player using all of the new room: matches
# shorten from 23.3 to 20.8 turns at spread 0.3 and 19.7 to 18.3 at 1.0.
# That is the difficulty this knob is documented to buy (§9) — more ways to
# put a brick somewhere it cannot be saved — and a real player only spends
# the extra reach when they want it, so it is an upper bound on the cost.
const AIM_BOUND_CELLS := 2.5

# Sideways movement is stepped, not slid. A press is half a cell; holding a
# direction repeats that step after a delay, so long travel doesn't mean
# mashing. A whole cell is the dash, on its own button.
#
# The dash was a double-tap first — Don't Crash's lane-dash gesture, reused
# because it was already this game's vocabulary for "one discrete unit over".
# It is a button now because a double-tap and two deliberate half-steps are
# the same keypresses, so the game had to guess which one was meant from
# timing alone, and guessed wrong often enough to be worth removing. A
# separate key cannot be misread.
const STEP_CELLS := 0.5
const DASH_CELLS := 1.0
# The dash key and the direction keys are a chord, and either one may be the
# one you hold: hold a direction and press dash, or hold dash and press a
# direction. Both spell the same thing, which is what lets a player pick the
# order that suits the hand they have on the keyboard.
const HOLD_REPEAT_DELAY := 0.30
const HOLD_REPEAT_INTERVAL := 0.08
# How fast the brick chases the commanded position. High enough that a step
# reads as a snap rather than a glide, low enough that it is still a movement
# and not a teleport — and every frame of it is still collision-checked.
const FOLLOW_SPEED := 620.0

# A dash has to be *perceptible*, and the first version of it was not.
#
# It moved the brick a whole cell, correctly — but it got there by adding the
# second half of a cell to the half the first tap had already moved, at the
# same speed. So a double-tap and two ordinary taps produced the same
# distance at the same pace, and a measurement of both came back 1.00 cells
# and 1.00 cells. There was nothing to feel, which is indistinguishable from
# the input not working, and that is exactly what it was reported as.
#
# The distance was never the problem — the *sameness* was. So the dash moves
# a whole cell where a press moves half, covers that ground about twice as
# fast, and leaves an afterimage. The window is also a little wider than it was,
# since a double-tap nobody can confirm landed is a double-tap people give
# up on.
const DASH_FOLLOW_SPEED := 1400.0
const DASH_GHOST_TIME := 0.22
const DASH_GHOST_COPIES := 4

const ROTATE_LERP := 18.0

# Spawn height above the stack, and the speed it comes down at. They look
# like the same knob and they are not — this is the mistake that got made
# here, so it is written down.
#
# The turn was too slow: measured (PaceProbe), a 7.7s turn spent 3.8s on the
# descent, 2.5s of that with the brick still more than two cells above
# everything, against 2.6s settling and a 1.2s pause. Both numbers were cut
# to fix it — 7 cells to 5.5, and 58px/s to 105 — on the reasoning that they
# are the same second approached from two directions.
#
# They are not. **Speed is the pace knob; height is a readability one.** The
# distance above the stack is how much of the fall the player can see coming
# and plan against — where the brick is relative to the tower, whether the
# rotation is right, how far across it still has to travel — and shortening
# it does not make the turn feel quicker, it makes the brick feel like it
# appears already half-way down. Reported immediately from play as bricks
# starting too low, so the height went back to 7 cells and the speed stayed.
# The descent still costs about 2.2s against the original 3.8s, and all of
# that saving came from the half of the change that was actually about time.
#
# The floor on the height is the tallest half-extent any brick can have (a
# vertical I piece reaches 2 cells below its own centre); the ceiling is the
# top of the screen, since the camera holds the stack top at
# CAM_STACK_TOP_FRAC and the brick appears a fixed distance above that. 7
# cells puts a vertical I piece's top edge at roughly y=42 on screen.
const SPAWN_CLEARANCE := CELL * 7.0
const DESCEND_SPEED := 105.0 # px/s, ~2.8 cells/s
const SOFT_DROP_SPEED := 430.0 # px/s while `down` is held

# Contact tolerance for the three move queries. A move is refused only if it
# would put the brick *meaningfully* inside something, never for merely
# grazing it.
#
# This exists because of the lattice. Every command is a multiple of half a
# cell from x=0, so a brick's faces line up *exactly* with the faces of the
# bricks already stacked — and Godot counts two exactly-touching rectangles
# as a hit (measured: a 0.00px gap intersects, a 0.05px gap does not). So a
# brick descending flush past its neighbour had its next step down refused by
# a contact of literally zero depth, went limp in mid-air with nothing under
# it, and only started falling again when the player steered sideways.
# Settling makes it worse rather than better: a landed brick picks up a
# thousandth of a radian of lean, which pokes a corner a fraction of a pixel
# across the line into the column beside it. The case that was caught was
# refused by an overlap 0.23px wide.
#
# The skin comes off *across* the direction of travel and never along it, so
# a landing is still detected at the exact pixel of contact: on the way down
# a brick ignores what it grazes to its sides, but nothing it is coming down
# on. Rotation has no direction of travel, so it is trimmed on both axes.
#
# It is half FOOT_INSET on purpose and the two must stay in step. The feet
# that decide whether a brick is supported are inset by half of FOOT_INSET
# per side, so an overlap deep enough to refuse a descent is also deep enough
# for the feet to find. That is what keeps "blocked on the way down" and
# "something is underneath" the same event, instead of two events with a gap
# between them for a brick to hang in.
const QUERY_SKIN := TowerPiece.FOOT_INSET * 0.5
# An anti-deadlock backstop, and deliberately NOT a gameplay rule.
#
# The rule is: a turn ends when something is underneath the brick, never
# before. A brick pressed against the flank of a taller stack is touching
# something, but nothing is holding it up, so the player keeps steering and
# can always back out of it — every wedged position has an exit, since the
# brick got there by descending and can move back the way it came.
#
# This exists only for the case that exit is somehow unavailable, so a turn
# cannot hang forever. At 1.5s it was short enough to fire during ordinary
# play and take the brick away mid-placement, which is exactly the complaint
# it was supposed to fix. Six seconds is long enough that reaching it means
# someone is holding a direction into a wall on purpose.
const WEDGE_GRACE := 6.0

# --- Turn structure --------------------------------------------------------
const START_LIVES := 3

# The beat between "everything stopped" and the next brick, and there are two
# of them because there are two kinds of turn. A turn that cost somebody a
# life puts a message on screen and that message has to be readable, so it
# keeps its pause. A turn where nothing fell has nothing to say and nothing
# to read, and holding the game still for over a second to say it is exactly
# the dead air that got reported — most turns are this kind.
const RESOLVE_PAUSE_QUIET := 0.35
const RESOLVE_PAUSE_EVENT := 1.1

# A turn ends when the whole world is at rest, not when the brick lands: the
# interesting case is a brick that lands cleanly and then shoves the tower
# over three seconds later, and resolving on contact would score that against
# the wrong player. SETTLE_TIMEOUT is the backstop for a tower that has found
# some slow perpetual wobble it will not come out of.
#
# SETTLE_LINEAR and SETTLE_ANGULAR are the fault rule's guard and are
# deliberately not the pace knob: measured, the tower is genuinely still
# moving for most of the settle (72% of settling frames fail the linear test,
# with tumbles up to 5.3 rad/s), so loosening these would resolve turns on
# towers that are still falling and bill the collapse to the next player.
# SETTLE_HOLD is a different thing — it is the quiet period required *after*
# the motion has already stopped, and half a second of it was pure padding on
# top of a test the tower passes within 0.36s of a landing.
const SETTLE_LINEAR := 16.0
const SETTLE_ANGULAR := 0.18
const SETTLE_HOLD := 0.25
const SETTLE_TIMEOUT := 9.0

# Losing a brick and removing a brick are two different moments, and
# conflating them cost six seconds a turn.
#
# LOST_* is where a brick stops counting: below the underside of the slab
# there is nothing but sky, so a brick past it can never rejoin the tower and
# is scored as fallen immediately. DESPAWN_* is where it is finally freed,
# long after it has left the screen.
#
# Splitting them matters because a brick shrugged off a twenty-cell tower has
# to fall about 900px before it is anywhere near gone, which at MAX_FALL_SPEED
# is roughly six seconds — and a turn ends when everything is at rest, so
# waiting for that debris meant the settle timeout firing on 6.5% of turns
# (twelve times in one measured match) with the player watching "settling..."
# the whole time. Counted early and freed late, the turn ends when the *tower*
# has stopped, which is what the rule was always about.
#
# Both are fixed world values rather than camera-relative on purpose: the
# camera pans up with the tower, so a camera-relative floor would eventually
# rise above the platform itself and cull the bricks the tower stands on.

# Two framings, and the camera takes whichever sits lower.
#
# CAM_GROUND_FRAC is the resting shot: the platform low in frame with the
# ground under it, which is where a match starts and stays while the tower is
# short. CAM_STACK_TOP_FRAC is the climbing shot, which only takes over once
# the tower is tall enough that the resting shot would push the descending
# brick off the top of the screen.
#
# They have to be separate. A single fraction has to be low enough to sit the
# platform on the ground *and* high enough to leave the brick room to fall,
# and no one number is both — the first version used 0.48 for everything,
# which is why the platform floated in the middle of the screen.
