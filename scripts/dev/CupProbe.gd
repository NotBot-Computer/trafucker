##
##   godot --headless --fixed-fps 240 res://scenes/dev/CupProbe.tscn
##
## Pile Up's cups (GameSettings.tower_cup), checked by playing them: whole
## cups, round after round, every round a real match with blind aim (spread
## 0.3, as TeamProbe), until somebody wins. Two parts:
##
##   sums   — the arithmetic on its own: which variants a cup cycles through
##            at each count (co-pilot only with four), 3/2/1/0 by place, tied
##            places sharing an award and skipping the next (1st, 1st, 3rd), a
##            result missing somebody still paying every place, the champion
##            rule when two cross the target in one round, and whose car each
##            trophy is — the round winner's, a winning team's alternating.
##   cups   — the solo cup at 2, 3 and 4 and the team cup at 3 and 4. Per
##            round: the variant is the next in the rotation, the match pays
##            out exactly once, every competitor is placed exactly once, and
##            the order is the one this probe *watched* happen — the winner
##            first, then (one tower) whoever ran out of lives last, or (a
##            race) whoever was still building, tallest first, then the
##            drop-outs, last out highest; or (co-op, a round of the solo cup)
##            fewest bricks dropped first, counted here turn by turn, with an
##            equal count an equal place. Every trophy a round hands out, to
##            every row, is a car of that round's winner. The tally screen is instantiated
##            after every round and must split the totals back into before
##            and this round's award, and name the same champion.
##
## It never changes scene: a finished round's own timer to the tally is
## cancelled here, and the tally is added as a child rather than loaded,
## because loading either would replace this probe. So the scene-to-scene
## hand-off itself is not covered — nor the keys, nor anything drawn.
