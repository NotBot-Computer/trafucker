##
## Where a Pile Up turn's seconds actually go, split into the three phases a
## player experiences differently: the descent they are steering through, the
## settle they are watching, and the pause before the next brick appears.
##
## It exists because "the hand-off takes too long" is a complaint about a
## total, and a total cannot be tuned — the first run of this probe found a
## 7.66s turn made of 3.84s of descent (2.51s of it before the brick was
## within two cells of anything), 2.62s of settling and a 1.20s pause, which
## is three different fixes wearing one symptom.
##
## The split that matters most is the last one it prints: **settling costs
## 1.25s when nothing fell and 3.74s when something did.** That difference is
## a brick tumbling the whole height of the tower to reach LOST_Y, and it is
## not padding — a turn ends when the world stops precisely so that a
## collapse is billed to whoever caused it. See §5 session T for the measured
## reason it cannot simply be skipped.
