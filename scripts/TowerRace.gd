## Pile Up's races — several towers side by side, built at the same time.
## TEAM RACE has two, one per team; RACE (the free-for-all one) has one per
## player, two to four. First tower to settle over the line wins. A tower
## that runs out of lives drops out where it stands and the rest race on; the
## last one left wins. Hexes cast on one tower land on another
## (TowerMode.receive_hex), on that tower's next brick.
##
## ## Why several TowerModes rather than one with several platforms
##
## A TowerMode is one turn loop: one brick in the air, one settle, one
## resolve. Teams building *at once* is several of those loops, and the
## mode's whole fault rule is built on there being exactly one — so a race is
## several complete, unmodified-in-spirit TowerModes, not a TowerMode taught
## to juggle. Each sits in its own SubViewport, and a SubViewport has its own
## World2D: its own physics space, its own current camera, its own canvas
## layers. A brick on one tower cannot touch another because they are not in
## the same world, not because anything checks.
##
## What a hosted tower does differently is small and lives behind
## `TowerMode.host`: it takes no input of its own (this script forwards every
## key to every tower, so none depends on which viewport Godot would deliver
## an event to), shows no game-over overlay, and reports its result here the
## frame it is known.
##
## ## Who a hex hits
##
## With two towers, the other one. With more, **the tallest rival** — ties to
## whoever is next in seat order after the caster. A hex aimed at a random
## rival is noise, and one aimed at the next seat is a feud between
## neighbours; aimed at the leader it is the race's catch-up rule, and one
## everyone can see coming because the progress bars say who is ahead.
##
## ## Why TextureRects and not SubViewportContainers
##
## The project stretches its 1500x800 canvas to the window ("canvas_items"),
## so on a high-DPI screen the root renders at the window's real resolution. A
## SubViewport renders at whatever size it is given, and a container sizes it
## in the root's *logical* pixels — so the towers would be drawn at their
## logical size and scaled up, visibly softer than everything else in the
## game. Instead each viewport is sized to the window's real pixels and told,
## through size_2d_override, to lay its 2D out at the logical size anyway; a
## TextureRect shows it. The tower cannot tell the difference —
## get_visible_rect() reports the override.
##
## At three or four towers a view is 500 or 375px wide, too narrow for the
## HUD's two side columns, and TowerHUD switches to its compact strip on its
## own (TowerHUD.COMPACT_BELOW).
