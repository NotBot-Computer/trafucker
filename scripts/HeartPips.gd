## The life pip both modes draw, and the rule that turns one red PNG into six
## players' colours.
##
## Lives arrived as a Don't Crash mechanic (session W) and the pip was built
## inside `PlayerBoard`. Pile Up already had lives of its own and drew them as
## flat circles — a different visual language for the same fact, in a game
## whose two modes share a menu flow, a colour per player and a countdown, and
## which therefore should not disagree about what "a life" looks like. Rather
## than copy the recolour loop into `TowerHUD` — the mistake `SpeedRamp`'s
## header records for the difficulty ramp, where two hand-synced copies of the
## same numbers eventually shipped a visible desync — the art, the recolour
## and the two numbers its loss animation is made of live here, and both
## callers reach in.
##
## What is deliberately NOT here: how many lives a mode grants, where the row
## sits, and how big a pip is drawn. Those are layout and balance rather than
## identity, they genuinely differ between a 620px-wide board and a 224px HUD
## card, and Pile Up's life count is a difficulty knob of its own
## (`TowerMode.START_LIVES`).

const TEXTURE := preload("res://sprites/ui/heart.png")

## Only the *saturated* pixels are re-hued. The heart's black outline and its
## white highlight carry no hue of their own, and leaving them alone is what
## keeps a tinted pip legible instead of flattening it into one blob of
## colour: modulating the whole image by the player's colour turns the red body
## muddy and the highlight into a wash of that same hue, and the outline
## survives only because black times anything is black.
const BODY_SAT := 0.25
## Floor on a skin colour's own brightness. Green (v 0.68) is the one skin dark
## enough to smudge into an unreadable blob at pip size.
const MIN_VALUE := 0.85

## A spent pip swells out of its slot and fades rather than simply vanishing:
## at pip size, one that disappears between two frames is one nobody sees
## leave, and "wait, how many did I have?" is the single question this readout
## exists to answer. Don't Crash animates this with a Tween on a real Sprite2D
## and Pile Up's drawn HUD interpolates it by hand, so the numbers — and the
## curve, see `loss_pose` — live here and the two stay one gesture.
const LOSS_POP := 2.2
const LOSS_DURATION := 0.45

# One texture per colour, kept for the life of the process. Pile Up's HUD is
# drawn rather than laid out, so it asks for its pips from inside _draw() —
# walking an 18x18 image once per card per frame would be silly — and the
# result cannot go stale, being a pure function of a colour and a preloaded
# PNG. Four players, six skins: this holds at most six 18x18 textures.

## The pip re-hued into `body_color`, so a glance at a row says whose lives
## they are without reading a name off it. Each body pixel keeps its own
## brightness so the art's shading survives the swap — `extract_heart.py`
## normalises the brightest body pixel to 1.0 for exactly that multiply, which
## is why nothing here knows anything about this particular PNG.

## Tween does — the point of this function is that a hand-driven redraw and a
## Tween can be read side by side and seen to agree.
